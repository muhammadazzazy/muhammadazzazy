I am a graduate in Computer Engineering from The American University in Cairo (AUC). Currently, I am a Linux System Administrator at Huawei.

Previously, I was a Research Assistant in the Chemistry Department at AUC, where I developed [_FebriLogic_](https://www.febrilogic.com), a tool that assists healthcare professionals in diagnosing patients with acute febrile illnesses. I am a former Full-Stack Engineering Intern at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Egypt Technology & Innovation Center (ETIC). My efforts have been recognized by data, cloud, and frontend engineers at PwC UK, and my manager, Bharath Natarajan, has published a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@bharathnatarajan101/genai-contract-processing-real-world-challenges-1e4396d78c20) detailing the challenges we tackled. My interests include research, software engineering, automation, and data-driven optimization.
